# image_metadata_extractor
To use the image_metadata_extractor.sh script for extracting metadata from images, follow these step-by-step instructions. This assumes the script is already written and ready for execution. The script's purpose is to extract metadata (like geolocation, camera details, timestamps, etc.) from images and check where the image has been used online, as you might have requested earlier.

Step-by-Step Guide:
1. Ensure Required Tools Are Installed
The image_metadata_extractor.sh script might require some external tools like ExifTool for metadata extraction and curl or wget for online searches. Install the required tools first:

ExifTool: Used for extracting metadata from images.

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libimage-exiftool-perl
curl/wget: For sending HTTP requests (if the script checks where the image is used online).

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install curl
or

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install wget

install requirements first then use /n
chmod +x image_metadata_extractor.sh /n
./image_metadata_extractor.sh
